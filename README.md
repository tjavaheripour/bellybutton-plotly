We visualized the bacterial data for each volunteer. Specifically, each volunteer should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.

Here, We use the knowledge of JavaScript, Plotly, and D3.js, create a horizontal bar chart to display the top 10 bacterial species (OTUs), a bubble chart that displays the amount of bacteria cultures per sample and then a gauge chart that shows the number of times a volunteer washes his or her belly button per week.
